### Getting Started
To get started:
1) `git clone https://github.com/IDEOorg/steps-bot`
2) `npm install`
Make your modifications, then push to Heroku (changes won't be applied locally because the FB and Twilio only recognize webhooks from this url https://stepsroobot.herokuapp.com).

TODO:
1) Document the flow of all the scripts
2) Fix text out of order bug
3) Send images via FB messenger
4) Simultaneous tasks feature
5) Complete all the scripts
6) Code refactoring
