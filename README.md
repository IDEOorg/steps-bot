### Getting Started
To get started:
1) `git clone https://github.com/IDEOorg/steps-bot`
2) `npm install`
Make your modifications, then push to Heroku (changes won't be applied locally because the FB and Twilio only recognize webhooks from this url https://stepsroobot.herokuapp.com).

### Dependencies
- Node 9.5.0
- npm 4.6.1
