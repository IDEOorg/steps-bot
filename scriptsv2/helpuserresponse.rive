  - Gotcha. Just to confirm, you'd like to send the following message to <get coachName>: "<get helpMessage>"
  ^ <fb>^template(`quickreply`, `Yes, send that`, `I have a few edits`, `Never mind`)</fb>
  ^ <sms><send>If you want me to send this to your coach, text the letter "S".\nIf you want to edit your response before I send it, text the letter "E".\nNo longer need help? Text the letter "N".</sms>
